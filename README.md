### Howdy Y'all 👋🤠

Who Am I:
## Mike Rosado (aka: Señor Pinky)
### Community Manager 🥑
My choice of pronouns are We/Us as an effort to build a more inclusive community.

Many people know me on social media as bona fide Señor Pinky 👁️💗2️⃣💪🏽♀️⚙️👩🏽‍💻 for a couple of reasons:

* <i>bona fide</i> means I’m sincere; without intention to deceive.
* <i>Señor</i> means Mister in Spanish.
* <i>Pink</i> or <i>Pinky</i> means Rosado in Spanish.
* The <i>emojis</i> represent my hard work of always looking for ways to increase Diversity & Inclusion.
