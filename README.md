### Hi there 👋

Who Am I:
## Mike Rosado (aka: Señor Pinky)
#### Community Advocate 🥑
My choice of pronouns are We/Us as an effort to build a more inclusive community.

Many people know me on social media as bona fide Señor Pinky 👁️💗2️⃣💪🏽♀️⚙️👩🏽‍💻 for a couple of reasons:

* bona fide means I’m sincere; without intention to deceive.
* Señor means Mister in Spanish.
* Pink or Pinky means Rosado in Spanish.
* The emojis represent my hard work of always looking for ways to increase Diversity & Inclusion.
